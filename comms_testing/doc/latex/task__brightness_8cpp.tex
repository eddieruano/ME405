\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the code for a task class which controls the brightness of an LED using a voltage measured from the A/D as input. The fun part: the brightness that is being controlled can be on another AVR computer, with signals being sent and received via wireless transceivers.

\item 09-\/30-\/2012 JRR Original file was a one-\/file demonstration with two tasks \item 10-\/05-\/2012 JRR Split into multiple files, one for each task \item 10-\/25-\/2012 JRR Changed to a more fully C++ version with class task\_\-sender \item 10-\/27-\/2012 JRR Altered from data sending task into LED blinking class \item 11-\/04-\/2012 JRR Altered again into the multi-\/task monstrosity \item 12-\/13-\/2012 JRR Yet again transmogrified; now it controls LED brightness\end{DoxyItemize}
