/** @file i2c_driver.cpp
 *  @brief     Driver for I2C Protocol, or Two Wire Interface.
 *
 *  @details   Based on JR Ridgely's methodology, incorporated with
 *             previous code already established. It is more tailored for
 *             specific use with our BNO055 IMU and establishes a more
 *             structured approach to performing the protocol. Furthermore,
 *             this driver cuts down on extra functions by creating 2
 *             universal fucntions for reading and writing instead of having
 *             seperate ones for different sizes of payloads.

        @ 5/30/2016 <<EDD>> added comments, updated license.
        @ 5/28/2016 <<EDD>> fixed everything and made everything more
 *       robust and fixed a much of calls. Made it so that it's easier
 *       to use function.

 *              PORTD, PINS[0,1] although it's not completely necessary since
 *              the ATmega1281 chip onboard controller for Two Wire Interface
 *              comms takes control of these lines, however for consistency
 *              and protection it's in the code. We also activate the two wire
 *              comms in the power reduction register and set no prescaler on
 *              the clock. Since no prescaler is declared the bitrate in TWBR
 *              can be low if the clock is high since we are trying to stay
 *              under 400,000 HZ total freq.
