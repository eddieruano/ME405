/** @file task_user.h
 *    Header file for task_user in which the prototypes for that class are

 *  Revisions:
 *    @li 09-30-2012 JRR Original file was a one-file demonstration with two tasks
 *    @li 10-05-2012 JRR Split into multiple files, one for each task
 *    @li 10-25-2012 JRR Changed to a more fully C++ version with class task_user
 *    @li 11-04-2012 JRR Modified from the data acquisition example to the test suite
 *    @li 01-04-2014 JRR Changed base class names to TaskBase, TaskShare, etc` *
