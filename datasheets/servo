shifter servo:
	low resolution requirements
	2 steady states: low gear and high gear

steering servo:
	high resolution requirements
	continuous states: (turn angles) <<, <, ^, >, >>

Available port/pins:
	B7	| <-T/C0: 8b, Output Compare A
		| <-T/C1: 16b, Output Compare C
	C0-C5	| no T/C
	D4	| ->T/C1: 16b, Input Capture Trigger (ICP ...?!)
	E	| <>T/C3: 16b, 7:ICP 5:OC3C 4:OC3B 3:OC3A
	F	| no T/C

* E 3-5 sound like the best choice, since we can configure the waves separately for A,B,C.
* B7 could work for one servo, but we have two.
* D doesn't work because it's input capture only, on the pin that's exposed.
* C and F have no timer connections, so they're out.
  > Besides, F is the ADC.

We may be able to reuse/copy the motor driver, just set up phase-correct PWM on E and set the duty cycles / timer values.

I *was* writing a software PWM driver, but I talked with Charlie and it's just not worth it.
  For one thing, making it a task wouldn't work because we need sub-millisecond accuracy.
  For another, that's a lot of timer interrupts just to hold two servo positions.
