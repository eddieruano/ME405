\subsection{Detailed Description}
Main driver for the Adafruit B\-N\-O055 I\-M\-U Sensor. Based heavily on K\-Town's driver created for the Arduino line, however optimized for speed. Based on K\-Town's layout, this driver focuses on obtaining data in a fast and constant way. It uses the M\-A\-X 400 K\-Hz speed on the B\-N\-O055 and sets the I\-M\-U at Startup. The I\-M\-U is ready to go approx 5 sec after it is powered on and can update every 100 ms or so before being slow.
