\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a very simple A/D converter driver. The driver is hopefully thread safe in FreeRTOS due to the use of a mutex to prevent its use by multiple tasks at the same time. There is no protection from priority inversion, however, except for the priority elevation in the mutex.

Revisions: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 01-\/15-\/2008 JRR Original (somewhat useful) file \item 10-\/11-\/2012 JRR Less original, more useful file with FreeRTOS mutex added \item 10-\/12-\/2012 JRR There was a bug in the mutex code, and it has been fixed\end{DoxyItemize}

This overloaded operator \char`\"{}prints the A/D converter.\char`\"{}. The precise meaning of print is left to the user to interpret; it should be something useful. For example, one might print the values of the configuration registers or show current readings from all the A/D channels. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
\item[{\em serpt}]Reference to a serial port to which the printout will be printed \item[{\em a2d}]Reference to the A/D driver which is being printed \end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A reference to the same serial device on which we write information. This is used to string together things to write with {\ttfamily $<$$<$} operators 
\end{DoxyReturn}
